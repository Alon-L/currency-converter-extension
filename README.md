# Currency Converter Extension

*This extension is currently available for Firefox*

### About
This project is my first browser extension. It was made for personal purposes, and therefore, doesn't support too many conversion currencies.

### How to install locally?
1. Clone the repository.
2. Achieve an API key from [Currency Convert API](https://www.currencyconverterapi.com/)
3. Create a new file under `src` called `apiKey.js` with the content:
    ```js
    apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
    ```
4. Apply the extension to Firefox.
